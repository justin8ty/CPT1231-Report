    Research Topic: This literature review examines the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity, focusing on the applications, advantages, challenges, and future directions in the field.

    Objectives of the Literature Review: The primary objective is to evaluate the current state of AI technologies in cybersecurity, analyze the progress made in various applications, and identify gaps in existing research. Additionally, the review seeks to understand the limitations and risks associated with AI-driven cybersecurity solutions and provide insights into future improvements.

    Scope of the Review: The review covers a wide range of AI applications in cybersecurity, including intrusion detection systems (IDS), malware detection, threat intelligence, and anomaly detection. It considers studies published over the last decade, focusing on the use of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The scope also extends to examining how AI is used to enhance security protocols across different sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure.

    Key Findings: AI technologies are transforming cybersecurity by offering more efficient and proactive defenses. Machine learning models are particularly effective in identifying new and evolving threats, while deep learning models have shown success in analyzing large volumes of data for intrusion and malware detection. However, there are challenges, such as AI models being vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the need for large datasets, and the potential for AI-generated false positives.

    Conclusion: AI is a powerful tool for advancing cybersecurity. To fully realize its potential, ongoing research must address challenges related to model vulnerability, ethical considerations, and the need for collaboration between AI developers and cybersecurity experts.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Background:} In the current digital landscape, where reliance on interconnected systems and data is greater than ever, cybersecurity has become a crucial component of both organizational resilience and national security. The pervasive nature of digital transformation has introduced a host of vulnerabilities, exposing critical infrastructure, financial systems, and personal data to potential cyberattacks. As cyber threats continue to grow in complexity and frequency, the need for advanced cybersecurity strategies that go beyond traditional defensive measures has become increasingly apparent.
    \item \textbf{Research Problem/Question:} Despite significant advancements and investments in cybersecurity, organizations continue to face increasing vulnerability to sophisticated cyber threats. Traditional reactive approaches often fail to keep up with the rapidly evolving attack landscape, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. There is a critical need to shift towards predictive cybersecurity, which utilizes historical data, trends, and machine learning models to forecast potential cyberattacks and mitigate risks preemptively. However, the integration of predictive models into existing frameworks, along with challenges in data quality, real-time analysis, and evolving threats, makes this shift difficult. This literature review examines the methodologies, challenges, and effectiveness of predictive cybersecurity in addressing these issues and enhancing proactive defense mechanisms to reduce the frequency and severity of cyber incidents.
    \item \textbf{Objectives of the Review:} To analyze the evolution of cyber threats and examine how cyber threats have evolved over time, focusing on the increasing sophistication of attacks and the limitations of traditional reactive cybersecurity approaches.
    \item \textbf{Scope of the Review:} This review will focus on predictive cybersecurity, specifically examining how historical data, trends, and patterns of cyberattacks can be leveraged to anticipate future incidents. Traditional reactive approaches to cybersecurity will only be discussed to highlight the limitations that predictive models aim to address.
